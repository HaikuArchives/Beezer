Many thanks to YNOP for providing the Be community with this
neat and easy to use SplitPane class. Thanks YNOP!

Original code by YNOP
Modifications -- Ramshankar (Ram) and Jeremy Friesner (jaf).

This program uses the modified version of the code as used in
BeShare 2.16 by Jeremy Friesner. (Don't ask my why).

Apart from this I have made several modifications to the SplitPane
class myself, most of the changes being so fine-tuned to suit
this project.

So DO NOT use this SplitPane in your own projects, get the
original SplitPane version directly from YNOP or from some
website.

This should NOT be considered a distribution from the author of
SplitPane. I recommend you to download the original SplitPane
class.

<P><B>Version 0.04 - (Released)</B>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Compiled for Zeta, locale kit compatible and fixed some zeta related bugs in Beezer
<LI>Shiny new 7zip add-on included, with password support and partial delete support (written by Marcin Konicki, with inputs and bug-fixes by me)
<LI>Fixed a bug in some add-ons for filenames starting with spaces (thanks to Marcin Konicki for suggesting this)

</UL></P>

<P><B>Version 0.03 - (<Font color=#999999>Unreleased</font>)</B>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Rar add-on now has full password support - password can be used for extracting and adding files
<LI>Fixed a minor bug in rar add-on that caused progress bar to unnecessarily update in test/extract functions
<LI>Rar add-on uses the newer unrar 3.10 for extraction purposes and older rar 2.x for creating/adding (many thanks to Miguel Guerreiro for suggesting this and for providing test files).  Because of the difference in rar and unrar versions, you will not be able to add files to a 3.x password-protected rar archive

<LI>Now right-clicking anywhere on the Infobar will toggles its visibility
<LI>Added startup options - can be accessed from Miscellaneous panel

<LI>Added a button in extract file panel to allow extraction to currently displayed folder
<LI>Fixed a rare bug that caused crash when trying to modify a corrupt/invalid archive
<LI>Rar add-on, with rudimentary password support, is now included (doesn't support deleting from rar archives)
<LI>Minor internal change caused all add-ons, main app to be recompiled
<LI>Replace "/" in Infobar by "of", makes it easier to read
<LI>Added a new Preference panel - "Interface", currently only one option, will be useful in future for adding colour prefs
<LI>Double-clicking a column now auto-sizes it to fit all visible column contents, similar to Tracker
<LI>Fixed a bug that showed "Adding error" or "Deleting error" when the archive resides on a filesystem without mime (thanks to Tim de Jong/Sir Mik for reporting)

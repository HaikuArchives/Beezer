<P>Thank you for trying out Beezer...</P>

<P>This introduction section is for you newbies or the type who actually read documentation before trying out the app. If you know what it is you will probably want to explore other parts of this documentation...</P>

<P>Beezer is a <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>WinZip</FONT></I> style utility for the BeOS written totally from scratch. It is a versatile, add-on based archiving utility designed to support most of the common archive formats such as zip, tar, gzip etc. It's a graphical front-end that tries and makes working with archives as easy as possible.</P>

<P>It's a heavily multi-threaded application providing a high level of responsiveness, the pros and cons of this aspect is discussed in other parts of this documentation. Beezer has gone through some highly stressful tests on a range of different computer configurations and should mostly be stable on any system that meets its <A HREF="Requirements.html">requirements</A>.</P>

<P>For all you curious types, and for those who asked me this at <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeShare</FONT></I> - Beezer means "large and impressive" according to The Webster, Indian Edition dictionary :^)</P>

<P>I hope you enjoy using Beezer as much as I enjoyed writing it. I work hard to make it as polished and error-free as possible. But due to the highly complex nature of this project, I'm not in a position to guarantee the quality of Beezer.</P>

<P>Thank you for using out Beezer!</P>

<P>This introduction section is for you newbies or the type who actually read documentation before trying out the app.</P>

<P>Beezer is a <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>WinZip</FONT></I> style utility for Haiku (and compatible operating systems) written totally from scratch originally for the BeOS. It's a versatile, add-on based archiving utility designed to support most of the common archive formats such as zip, tar, gzip etc. It's a graphical front-end that tries to make working with archives as easy as possible.</P>

<P>It's a heavily multi-threaded application providing a high level of responsiveness, the pros and cons of this aspect is discussed in other parts of this documentation. Beezer has gone through some stressful tests on a range of different computer configurations and should mostly be stable on any system that meets its <A HREF="Requirements.html">requirements</A>.</P>

<P>For all you curious types, and for those who asked me this at <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeShare</FONT></I> - Beezer means "large and impressive" according to The Webster, Indian edition dictionary :^)</P>

<P>I hope you enjoy using Beezer as much as I enjoyed writing it. I work hard to make it as polished and error-free as possible, but due to the complex nature of this project, I'm not in a position to guarantee the quality of Beezer. It's free software, use at your own risk!</P>

<P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Best regards,<BR><BR>

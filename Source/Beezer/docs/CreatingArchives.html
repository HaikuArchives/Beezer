<P>When you choose to create a new archive, a file requester prompts you to enter the location (path) and name of the archive. You can also select the type of archive to create from the nearby pop-up menu. Once you have enter the name of the archive and selected the type of archive, click the "Create" button.</P>

<P><I>Do NOT choose the files you wish to add in this file requester</I>. This file requester is only for choosing the name, type and location of the archive you wish to create and NOT what files should be in the archive. The following file requester is for that.</P>

<P>Next, you will see another file requester that prompts you to add the files & folders you wish to add to the archive. Here, depending on the type of archive you have selected, the archiver's settings menu can be found in the menubar. Look at the picture below, that shows the settings menu being accessed.</P>

<P>The advantage of accessing the menu here is that you get to adjust the options BEFORE creating the archive. Say, for example, you are zipping mp3s (to transfer them with their attributes to another BeOS system via FTP), you might want to set the compression level to zero (no compression just store) as it makes things much faster and the size-tradeoff is less. Thus you can do so right here by choosing the compression level.</P>

<P>Also, if the archive supports password protection for files, you will see a textbox on the left-bottom of the add panel (not shown on the above illustration) which allows you to supply the password to use to encrypt the files in the archive. You can leave/set this password field to blank to specify no password protection for the files you are about to add.</P>

<P>Once you have chosen the files you wish to add, click the "Add" button. Then a new archive will be created and the files you chose will be added to it. Click <A href="AddingFiles.html">here</a> for info on the add process.</P>

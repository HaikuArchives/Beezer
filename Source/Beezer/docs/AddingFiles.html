<P>Beezer allows you to add files & folders (entries) to any folder inside the archive and not just at the root of the archive.</P>

<P>Before adding entries you need to choose where to add them (unless you are adding files through drag 'n drop). The following paragraph explains where Beezer will add new files:</P>

<UL type=disc>
<LI><B>If you have selected a file</B>, newly added entries will be added in the same folder as the selected file.
<LI><B>If you have selected a folder</B>,  newly added entries will be added inside the selected folder.
<LI><B>If you have no selection</B> newly added entries will be added to the root of the archive.
</UL>

<P> If you have multiple selections before adding entries, the first visible selected item will be used.</P>

<P>Once you have chosen where to add the files, you can choose any of the following actions:</P>

<UL type=disc>
<LI>From <FONT FACE=helvetica COLOR=navy>Actions &ndash;&gt; Add</FONT>, or
<LI>From <FONT FACE=helvetica COLOR=navy>toolbar: Add</FONT>
</UL>

<P>A file requester will pop-up asking you to choose which files and folders you wish to add. After choosing them, press the "Add" button and the selected entries will be added to the archive.</P>

<A NAME="dragdrop"></A>
<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Drag 'n Drop</FONT></B>
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=95%><TD>
<P>You can also add entries to the archive  by dropping them from <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>Tracker</FONT></I> to the <a href="ArchiveWindow.html#treeview">treeview</a>. In this case, the selected entry will NOT be used to determine where the new entries will be added. Rather a horizontal marker (that appears as you drag the entries to be added) will determine where new entries are added.</P>

<P>When you drag your mouse over the treeview you will see a horizontal line. This is the location where the dropped entries will be added. If you want to add the files at the root of the archive, press <TT><B><FONT COLOR=purple>SHIFT</FONT></B></TT> and you will see the horizontal line turn red.</P>

<P>Thus dropping entries when the line is blue, adds them to that location, dropping entries when the line is red adds the entries root of the archive.</P>
</TD></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The process of adding is shown by a progress bar. If the files you are adding already exist in the archive, the replacement action in <a href="Preferences.html#add">Preferences: Add</A> would be used.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">Cancelling the operation</FONT></B>
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=95%><TD>
<P>You can cancel this operation while it is in progress, but doing so will leave the archive in an indeterminate state - regarding the physical changes to the archive. This is because different archivers react differently when they are stopped before completing their task. For example, some archives automatically undo the changes while some don't. Thus you will have to re-load the archive.</P>

<P>In general it's not advisable to cancel this operation, as it can leave your archive corrupted. You have been warned! :)</P>

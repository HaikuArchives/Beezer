<P>Add-ons, also referred to as archivers are independent modules that handle various archive types. Add-ons are named "ark_zip", "ark_tar" etc. Additional add-ons maybe written to support more archive formats.</P>

<P>Workers in Beezer are those command-line programs that physically manipulate the archives, such as <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>zip</FONT></I>, <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>unzip</FONT></I>, <I><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>tar</FONT></I> etc. Workers are placed in the <TT><FONT color=#008800>workers</FONT></TT> folder and in general you must NOT rename or delete any of them. By default they are all symbolic links that point to the location where the actual command-line program is suppose to reside. If you find "broken" links in this folder that means, either you don't have the command-line program installed or you have it installed in someother location. To fix this, either install the command-line program in the place where the link points to, or replace the link itself by a copy of the program.</P>

<P>The reason why workers are made as symbolic links is because, in case a future version of the worker binary BREAKS compatibility with Beezer, you can use the older version by replacing the symbolic link with the older version file.</P>

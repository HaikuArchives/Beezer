# Mime correction rules for Beezer
# 
# Beezer checks the file extension and accordingly checks the
# mime type. If the extension and mime type doesn't match,
# Beezer removes the wrong mime type and asks BeOS
# to re-correct the mime type.
#
# If you don't understand this you probably shouldn't alter
# anything. The rules are of the obvious format:
# mimetype=extension

Things to do before releasing the app on the Internet:

¶ Make sure the "VersionHistory.html" file is updated

¶ Make sure the "AppConstants.h" has the correct version number

¶ Remove the DDEBUG flag in BeIDE - but this is a pain as when I start
	coding again it will be a bother to recompile everything when its turned back on,
	So maybe this can be avoided

¶ Move any older versions of Beezer and its SoftwareValet package files to
	"_OlderVersions" folder located in this folder's parent folder.
